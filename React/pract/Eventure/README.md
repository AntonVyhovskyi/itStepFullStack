This was an event calendar project built with React. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete events tied to specific dates. The user interface was styled using Tailwind CSS, providing a clean and responsive design.

For state management, I used Redux Toolkit. Forms were handled with Formik, combined with Yup for validation. UUID was used to generate unique IDs, and Day.js helped with flexible and concise date manipulation and formatting.
