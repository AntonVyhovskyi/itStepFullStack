Reaction Game in JavaScript (Exam Project)

This project is an interactive browser-based reaction game, created as part of a JavaScript exam.
The goal of the game is to click on targets that appear randomly on the screen before they disappear. Each successful click increases the score, while a missed target ends the game and saves the result.

ðŸ›  Technologies and Tools:
HTML, CSS â€“ for basic layout and styling.

Vanilla JavaScript â€“ used to build game logic, manage timers, states, handle user interactions and DOM manipulation.

SessionStorage â€“ to store and display previous results.

Hosted on GitHub â€“ the game is available online via a public link.

ðŸŽ® Features:
Three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard.

Dynamic target appearance speed depending on the chosen level.

Real-time score counter.

Game ends on a miss and saves the result.

List of previous scores saved in sessionStorage.

The entire project is built with plain JavaScript, without any frameworks or libraries.
