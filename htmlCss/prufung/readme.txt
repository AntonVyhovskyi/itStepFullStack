Responsive Fitness Studio Website (Exam Project)

In this project, I built a responsive website layout for a fitness studio as part of my final exam. I used HTML fundamentals with a strong focus on semantic tags to ensure accessibility and clean structure.
All styling was done using native CSS, following the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for maintainable and scalable code.
I also added subtle CSS animations to enhance the user experience.

The layout was built using a mobile-first approach, ensuring excellent performance and appearance across different screen sizes and devices.
